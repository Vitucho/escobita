/─┬─model/─┐ : The abstractions regarding the game itself and its internal logic
  │        └─ // TODO : explains a litte more key abstractions
  |
  ├─repositories/ : Handling of model abstractions that exists over an underlying persistence storage
  │
  ├─presentation/─┐ : Code regarding exposing to clients a way to work with the model and "delivering" meaningful data
  │               ├─web/─┐ : HTTP REST API + Web browser GUI
  |               |      ├─ assest       : content for web browser GUI clients
  |               |      ├─ controllers  : receving requests, process and dispaching responses (uses repositories to work with persistent data)
  |               |      └─ services     : code that actually "talks" to the model abstractions plus additional code that arises from specific functionality tangled into web affairs (like a users' messaging system)
  │               │
  │               ├─cli/ : A very basical implementation of the game using the command line (has pending work to do)
  │               ├─commmon/ : Common functionallity common to any kind of presentation (e.a: working with underlying OS's filesystem)
  │               └─native-gui/ : OS native GUI (next summer...)
  │
  └─main.go: on launch.. code executes from here
